# datapack-regunex-farmdeli-cutting

A datapack for minecraft that adds recipes for cutting the bark off Regions Unexplored wood with the Farmer's Delight cutting board.

This pack is based on recipes found in [this datapack which provides the same recipes for Biomes O' Plenty](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/biomes-o-plenty-x-farmers-delight-bark-cutting), and which showed me just how to set this sort of thing up. Thank you to DJBaphomet for providing me with an example to follow!
